# Chat App
A socket.io messaging app.

## To Do
  - Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
  - Add support for usernames.
  - Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he/she presses enter.
  - Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
  - Show who’s online.
  - Add exclusive group chats.
